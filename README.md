# 🐍 Python_LearningPath 🎓

This project is the result of my learning path in Python and Machine Learning (ML) that I had to do during my university process. It contains filtering and data collection exercises with Python, and as a final process, a chatbot.

## 📚 Repository Content.

The repository contains the following main components:

1. **Data Filtering Exercises**: These exercises demonstrate my ability to manipulate and filter data using Python. The exercises cover a variety of filtering techniques, including the use of regular expressions, condition-based filters, and more.

2. **Data Collection Exercises**: In this section, I show my experience in collecting data from various sources using Python. This includes extracting data from CSV files, SQL databases, web APIs and more.

3. **Training a model**: As a final project, I have developed a training using ML techniques. Can respond to a variety of queries and demonstrates my ability to apply ML concepts in a practical project ussing Python.

## 💻 Technologies Used.

- **Python**: Main programming language used for all exercises and chatbot development.
- **Machine Learning**: Used in the development of the chatbot to enable intelligent responses to user queries.
